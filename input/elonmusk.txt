Also, if your tweet is bookmarked, it will be treated as a “quiet like and increment your likes counter. Major Twitter improvement we just released is that you can now bookmark tweets from tweet details page.  Importantly, bookmarks are *private*, unlike likes. No one other than you can see your bookmarks. Twitter app update now available on App Store userEvaFoxU True userBillyM2k 🥳🥳 userTitterTakeover Onboarding should have fewer steps, not more, but creating pinned lists should automatically be offered if you swipe past Following.

Tap Lists on your profile page. 2. Create list of accounts to follow. 3. Tap pin icon.   This allows you to swipe left/right between For You, Following and Lists. userSawyerMerritt userTesla Teslas are the safest cars on the road, but most people dont know that usermorganisawizard Bolitho also fought in the Battle of the Somme.

In the end, the government will be forced to tax everyone to pay the debt.  Btw, $31T doesnt include unfunded liabilities, which are *much* higher. usercbdoge userElijahSchaffer If bots are removed from the system, their likes will be removed too. Are you seeing likes from clearly human accounts disappear? userElijahSchaffer Are you still finding engagement to be low? userteslaownersSV The kind words are appreciated usermicsolana userteslaownersSV userSjvTesla One of the bot defenses we implemented was flagging any account responding to tweets faster than humanly possible userstillgray Good question to ask him userteslaownersSV userSjvTesla It is very difficult to stop bots & trolls, while not affecting real users. Wont be perfect either way, but Twitter is far more resilient to fake accounts than it ever has been. Twitter is arguably already the least wrong source of truth on the Internet, but we obviously still have a long way to go.  Enabling userCommunityNotes to operate at very large scale and providing maximum transparency about how Twitter works are fundamental to building trust.

To be clear, Im not someone who thinks lots of government agencies should be abolished maybe a few, but we should always question our institutions, as this strengthens the bedrock of democracy. Why did American media go from questioning the State and “speaking truth to power to doing their bidding? userBillyM2k userunusualwhales 🤣 useralx Will be interesting to see how the Biden administration reacts to this.

When the economy is not changing rapidly, actually measuring things isnt important, as you can simply extrapolate from the past. userImMeme0 Is it even possible to parody their tweets?

Basically saying if you love trashing *that* account, then you will probably also love trashing *this* account. Not actually wrong lol. userBillyM2k Should Twitter keep it active? userjacobin This is a rare case where I agree with Jacobin.

But thats actually the point I was making: state influence/affiliation with media is far more common than most people realize – just look at how much Twitter/FB/Google have been influenced! userBrookstone23 userrealchrisrufo userwef There are some really funny WEF parody accounts, although its legit hard to tell WEF truth from WEF parody sometimes! userrealchrisrufo Sensible thread.

However, if executive and legislative branches are dominated by *one* party, then we lose balance of power. Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide whos in charge! To independent-minded voters:  Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic.

If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools. userkadubai11 userspideycyp155 But, hey, look on the bright side! At least Russia doesnt get Crimea in that scenario, so you can be comforted by that thought, while watching the mushroom clouds rise. userkadubai11 userspideycyp155 If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO, they will use nukes, then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over userspideycyp155 Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia.   Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.  From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii & Pearl Harbor. userhyiki22 userspideycyp155 Exactly userspideycyp155 If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.

Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context. userPPathole userashleevance Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better. userashleevance The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically, GPS doesnt work on battlefields, as the signal is easy to jam, but Starlink does. userajtourville Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.

Booster dome is 4mm. userDJSnM userErdayastronaut userSpaceX userCasparStanley userIzanRamos2002 Electric power for booster & ship is needed even when engines arent running & incremental power draw of TVC isnt too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes. userErdayastronaut userSpaceX userCasparStanley userIzanRamos2002 Enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save over 10 tons, all things considered.  Shrouds are also a risk in that fuel leaks could be contained by the shroud, forming a MOX bomb.  Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this. userErdayastronaut userSpaceX userCasparStanley userIzanRamos2002 All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass, eg shrouds, TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.  Raptors in production now have electric TVC, saving over a ton of hydraulics mass on booster.

SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 & has docked with Station much harder than docking with our own ship over 20 times. userwapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.  Without flaps & heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs dont add much 1/6 gravity.

Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large. userBBCAmos userNASASpaceflight Ok userWholeMarsBlog userNASASpaceflight userBBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:  Booster - Grid fins for aero control - Boostback & landing propellant tanks - Protecting engines from entry loads  Ship - Body flaps for aero control - Deorbit & landing propellant tanks - Heat shield userAstroElliott userNASASpaceflight userBBCAmos Inevitably userNASASpaceflight userBBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity.

However, pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only 2 grid fins, with some effect on accuracy. userTeslaFruit Thanks Sandy! Super Heavy Booster moving to orbital launch mount URL userErcXspace Very close to real! Arms are able to move during descent to match exact booster position.

We have to keep some secrets!   We have a few ideas for increasing torque & max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun & exciting engineering ahead! userajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal usually high strength steel.   Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve mostly stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration. userajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.  Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.   Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator. userAlternateJones True userPPathole Deriving moments of inertia from first principles Esoteric meme of the day URL userBrianNorgard Physics should be taught with the majesty & beauty it deserves userBrianNorgard Physics is simply the search for truth.

It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software & engine.   Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem.

They dont consider that reliable. userRationalEtienne userryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles & 40 cycles is their max. userPPathole Strange userryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold & flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms & falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu. userryaneshea From URL URL userdanaemorgan Sure is Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. Whats the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests? userClareCraigPath Interesting userjohnbeans userDirtyTesla Interesting What is the general population no knowledge of symptoms accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test & is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles? userPPathole usercleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too.

That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later. userZainRaz4 uservincent13031925 userJonErlichman Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production & logistics hell. uservincent13031925 userJonErlichman I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup considered super quirky back then, while stalwarts like GM & Chrysler were going bankrupt. userJonErlichman That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night & we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didnt own a house & had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time. userjoshbickett userPPathole Yes userPPathole Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge useritshamzahkhan As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year. userthesheetztweetz Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed.

Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy. userraytech247 userWholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three. userEvaFoxU userWholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration & 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but its fun & takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people & hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly. userskorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate. userWholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I cant emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part. userWholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars & stationary storage userWholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack & front & rear single piece castings.

I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the small composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections. userPPathole useralvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all thats needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour. useralvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster & 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster & fairing by end of next year. 4th flight & landing for this booster 5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far. usercleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another cars exhaust pipe. userSciGuySpace Its a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026.

That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds! usernextspaceflight Payload reduction due to reusability of booster & fairing is &lt;40% for F9 & recovery & refurb is &lt;10%, so youre roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3 userzubinanary userSpaceIntellige3 userguidodecaso usercnunezimages Yes, it will have huge nuts haha userTeslarati We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too.

There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering. userSPEXcast userErdayastronaut userSpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars. userErdayastronaut userSpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time.

Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.

Human character at its best. Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull.

All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. Its a beast. userjevjack1 Cant be too buoyant Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does. userArkadiuszKula userJL2579 userMattyIce4412 userthanr userJamesWorldSpace Good idea userJL2579 userMattyIce4412 userthanr userJamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank butt end fwd to take impacts in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack. userLittleMissFlint Youre welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂 userMattyIce4412 userthanr userJamesWorldSpace Yeah, thats what Im talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying. userwilliamwinters useraustinhopperrrr usermaysacha userthanr userJamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall. userjeremysliew Its open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution usersiwgrindaker usererikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large. usererikveen I would def recommend this userthanr userJamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work? userbonnienorman userTeslaBull usertrippedover Interesting userthanr userJamesWorldSpace Great, thanks userJamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab. userladykayaker userJamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water wont come in userthanr userJamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed. userJamesWorldSpace SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person. userJamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit. userchiefpad userJamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction half stress of longitudinal direction userladykayaker userJamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if youre in an air tube, time doesnt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections. userJamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole. userMelissaLeeCNBC userthesheetztweetz userCNBC userLebeaucarnews I know you & believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said userjowens510 userlopezlinette I didnt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots dont work for me.

Is this true? usergawwy useraperezposada userReuters usersal19 Wow, so usersal19 of userReuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production & followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work usersal19 & userReuters. useraperezposada userReuters .userReuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number? useraperezposada userReuters .userReuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week.

Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak & a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation. userEvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose. userDanAloni userxJawz userjoerogan Thats really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what “money is. userxJawz userjoerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced & above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

Just curious. userdoctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right. userdimas userRobotbeat userdoctorow UAW doesnt have 30% of signatures about 6000 people needed for a vote.

Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Dont want Tesla to die too. userRobotbeat userdoctorow I am too, of sorts.

Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced. usersamuelrogg userElectrekCo userFredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability.

Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production. userElectrekCo userFredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days.

First time weve seen anything like this. userElectrekCo userFredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers userElectrekCo userFredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address.

You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine! Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions. Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph. userPPathole Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time. Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included apart from Autopilot. Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track. Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range userplotqasc Its only slightly more expensive to Tesla same price to car owners, but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing userclemyeung Exactly Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps.

Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom. Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0. The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors userMarekCyzio Exactly First, its important to know that Tesla is the most shorted meaning most bet against stock on the market & has been for a while URL Please ignore this thread unless youre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock userAtaraxiaInvest userMKBHD userHyperChangeTV They were neither valid nor pertinent.

If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h. As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance dont mean much for orbit. All about speed. usermbhnyc steel collet Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Wont be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. URL userUncleGus probably However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didnt latch, so it tipped over after landing. Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, thats also translating & rotating. Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines. Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.

That was bad CO2 for indiv, this for the planet Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change URL Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone. Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost & shift to sustainable energy Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere. Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?

A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt! Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension & mega torque. Technically, I got rich from Zip2 & PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla & SolarCity. If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods & critical meds. userponder68 Carbon produced by a userSpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt. Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems. Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution. Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money : Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway. Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases ie consumption. Much better to emphasize the latter. userMaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually not always better than the smartest govt regulator. Me & other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way. usergrayj There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census. Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes dont ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases. Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide. Perhaps.
